        You can use either absolute or relative path.
        In case relative path is used, the build system uses NRF parent directory.
        Script need to accept two arguments:
        - --input-file <STRING> - location of unsigned envelope in the build system
        - --output-file <STRING> - location of signed envelope to create by script
